"""Pause Frametop for VR games, so it leaves the headset's CPU and GPU to the game. The input
relay (input-relay.py) runs this: it's the one part of Frametop that always runs.

Paused:
  - The gaze service stops (frametop-gaze: ft-gazed, ft-gaze, our own eye tracker ft-eyes, the
    gaze panel), and with it every read of SteamVR's eye tracking. Our frame grabber, the root
    service ft-eyegrab, goes idle by itself 3 seconds after ft-eyes stops asking for frames.
  - Hand tracking stops if it runs (frametop-camd, frametop-hands).
  - The desktop, by "pause_desktop": "hide" (the default) hides every screen and floating window
    and slows the desktop down ("pause on" to ft-screens: KWin gets one frame callback a second
    instead of 90, so it and the apps on it hardly draw), and remote desktop stops if it runs
    (session/remote-ctl.sh: krdp, Xvnc, FreeRDP). Windows stay open. "close" closes the desktop
    (desktops.sh stop): its windows close, and resuming starts it again (about 12 seconds), in
    its start profile if it has one.
  - In the relay: the 3D mouse lets go and the mouse is a plain mouse for SteamVR, typing goes to
    Steam, and mapped buttons and key combinations do nothing but PAUSED_ACTIONS and commands.
Resuming starts again only what pausing stopped. The pointer helper and ft-powerd keep running:
they cost little, and the helper is what says a VR game started.

Toggled by:
  - The pause_toggle action: a mouse button, a key combination, or a controller button outside
    games (the pointer helper only reads those outside games).
  - A controller gesture, by default both thumbsticks clicked together twice ("pause_gesture").
    It's read from vrserver's web socket (vrws.py), which works in games and takes nothing from
    them, so the game sees the clicks too.
  - input/ft-pause on|off|toggle|status, which uses the relay's control socket
    ("pause on|off|toggle|?").
  - VR games, with "pause_auto" (on by default): the pointer helper says "vrgame 1|0" as a SteamVR
    scene app starts and ends (and every 5 seconds). A game starting pauses; a pause that starts
    while a game runs ends RESUME_DELAY after the game does, unless another game starts first.
    Toggled back on during a game, Frametop stays on until that game ends. A pause that starts
    outside a game lasts until it's toggled off.

Settings in ~/.config/frametop-input.json (Frametop Input Settings, Game optimization page): "pause_auto"
(bool), "pause_gesture" ({"buttons": one or two controller buttons, "presses": 1 or 2}, or null
for none; one button always takes two presses), "pause_desktop" ("hide" or "close"), and
"pause_sound" (a sound on pause and resume; bool). The state outlives a relay restart in
STATE_PATH.
