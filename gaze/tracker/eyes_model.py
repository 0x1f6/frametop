"""The gaze calibration: from pupil and glint positions to head-relative gaze angles.

Shared by ft-eyes (live) and the lab tools (fitting and scoring on recordings). Gaze angles are
ft-gaze's: degrees relative to the head, yaw positive to the left, pitch positive up.

Per eye (0 = right, camera 0; 1 = left, camera 1), three quadratic fits:
  pupil   pupil centre -> gaze. The one used for output, after the slip correction.
  glint   pupil minus the glint pair's midpoint -> gaze. Slip moves both alike, so this
          holds up when the headset shifts, but it's noisier, and the pair is often gone.
  where   gaze -> pupil centre: where the pupil sits for a gaze, with no slip.
Slip: wherever the pair is seen, `glint` gives the gaze, `where` says where the pupil should
be, and the difference is how far the eye has moved in the image. Slip changes slowly, so
the median over the last SLIP_WINDOW seconds shifts every frame, glints or not.

That glint estimate is only good to 1-4 px (1-3 degrees), though. Clicks are better: each one
says where the pupil should have been for a known gaze (`where`), so pupil minus that is the
shift. `Shift` keeps the median of the last few, and uses the glints only to notice a sudden
jump (the headset nudged or put back on), until clicks catch up. On practice2 with
practice1's calibration: 1.2 degrees median, against 2.7 with the glints alone (findings.md).
