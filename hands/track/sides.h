// Are the side cameras' images under the right names? ft-camd tells slam_left's buffers from
// slam_right's only by the order XRService allocated them, and some XRService starts reverse
// that order: then each side camera's images carry the other's name, every hand is seen by one
// camera only, at the wrong depth, and the cutouts land beside the hands.
//
// SideCheck tells from the hands the tracker already finds. Whenever a hand's landmarks are
// found in two cameras in the same frame set (one of them a side camera), the rays through its
// 21 landmarks are intersected twice: with the calibrations as the images are named, and with
// the two side cameras' calibrations exchanged. The same hand seen right meets within a few mm,
// in front of both cameras and as far away as its apparent size says; under the wrong naming
// the rays miss by centimetres or meet behind a camera. Each such pair is a vote. It decides once
// one way has min_clean votes and the other none, or min_votes with at most max_other of all
// votes the other way, over at least min_span_s of hands.
//
// The tracker's own views rarely give a pair when the names are wrong: it hands a hand over
// to the other cameras where the wrong calibration puts it, finds nothing there, and keeps it in
// one camera (the replays of swapped recordings: one hand, every handoff a miss, no pair). So
// probe() looks for itself, 5 times a second while it's checking: it takes a hand the tracker
// sees, places it in 3D from that one view (as far as its size says) with the side cameras
// exchanged, and runs the landmark model where that puts it in the other side camera, at 0.8,
// 1 and 1.25 times the one-view distance. That's the tracker's handoff under the other naming
// (the tracker does it under the current one every step); the palm detector misses many of
// these hands, which the landmark model finds from a good crop. What it finds is a view
// like the tracker's, and the test above votes on it: finding a hand there proves nothing by
// itself. It doesn't depend on how the tracker paired the views up.
//
// FT_SIDES_DEBUG=1 in the environment prints each probe's crop and what it found (stderr).
//
// Upper-camera pairs with a side camera count too (the upper pair's own naming was checked
// stable: tools/check_sides.py --pair upper). Two upper views alone say nothing.
